# Drupal Module for Po.et

The Drupal Po.et module automatically submits articles to the Po.et blockchain via the Frost API.

Please Note: Articles are only published to the Po.et testnet at this time.

## Installation

Download the Drupal Po.et module from https://github.com/knowledgearcdotorg/drupal-poet-module/releases.

Use the Drupal module installer to install.

## Configuration

First you'll need an API token. This can be created via the Frost Dashboard (https://frost.po.et).

Add the API token you created via the Frost Dashboard.

Log into Drupal as administrator and click on Extend -> List. Select the Po.et module and install.

Once installed, go to Configuration. Under System you will see the Po.et module. Click on it and add your API token then save.

## How it works

The Po.et module will automatically publish your article to the Po.et blockchain when you create or edit an article which is published.

The title, description, date created, date published and tags are stored on the Po.et blockchain.

## Verifying that your article is published on Po.et

The Po.et module will add a "Verified on Po.et" badge to articles you have successfully published to Po.et.
